## Views

The `Mobiles` app comprises six different views, each serving a specific functionality and accessible through different
routes. Below is a brief overview of each view:

1. [Nationality Views](views/nationality.md): This section covers views responsible for managing nationalities. It
   includes functionality for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting nationalities.

2. [Brand Views](views/brand.md): This section covers views responsible for managing mobile brands. It includes
   functionality for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting brands.

3. [Mobile Views](views/mobile.md): This section covers views responsible for managing mobile models. It includes
   functionality for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting mobile models.

4. [Variant Views](views/variant.md): This section covers views responsible for managing mobile variants. It includes
   functionality for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting variants with different colors and sizes.

5. [PriceHistory Views](views/price.md): This section covers views responsible for managing price histories of mobile
   variants. It includes functionality for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting price histories.

6. [All Views](views/all.md): This section covers views that provide an overview of all mobile information at once.

## Models

The `Mobiles` app consists of a Base model and five different models , representing essential entities within the mobile
storage system. Below is an overview of each model:

1. [Base Model](models/base.md): Base model.

2. [Nationality](models/nationality.md): This model represents the nationality. It includes fields for storing
   nationality names.

3. [Brand](models/brand.md): This model represents mobile brands, including their names and associated nationalities.

4. [Mobile](models/mobile.md): This model represents specific mobile models associated with a brand and a country.

5. [Variant](models/variant.md): This model represents different variants of a mobile model, including color and size.

6. [PriceHistory](models/price_history.md): This model represents the price history of a mobile variant. It includes
   fields for storing variant prices and a status indicator.

## Serializers

The `Mobiles` app utilizes four different serializers to convert complex data types into Python data types that can be
rendered into JSON for API responses. Below is an overview of each serializer:

> Note: You can find the implementation of these serializers in
> the [serializers.py](../../src/mobiles/serializers.py) file.

1. **BrandSerializer**: This serializer handles the serialization of `Brand` model data for API responses. It includes
   the `name` and `nationality` fields of the brand and also nests related `Mobile` objects.

2. **MobileSerializer**: This serializer handles the serialization of `Mobile` model data for API responses. It includes
   the `brand`, `model`, `country`, and `variants` fields of the mobile. The serializer also nests related `Variant`
   objects.

3. **VariantSerializer**: This serializer handles the serialization of `Variant` model data for API responses. It
   includes the `mobile`, `color`, `size`, `prices`, and `image` fields of the variant. The serializer also nests
   related `PriceHistory` objects.

4. **PriceHistorySerializer**: This serializer handles the serialization of `PriceHistory`
   model data for API responses. It includes the `variant`, `price`, `status`, and `date` fields of the price history.
